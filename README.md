Customer Segmentation

Project Overview

This project aims to perform Customer Segmentation using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques. By analyzing customer demographics (age, income) and spending behavior, this project seeks to uncover valuable insights that businesses can use to create targeted marketing strategies. The visualizations presented in this project include histograms, KDE plots, and pair plots to show the distribution of customer attributes and relationships between key variables.

Installation Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine:
	1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
	2.	Navigate into the project directory:
cd customer-segmentation
	3.	Install the required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
	1.	Download and place the dataset Mall_Customers.csv in the project directory.
	2.	Open the project in your preferred IDE or Jupyter Notebook.
	3.	Run the Python script (customer_segmentation.py) or Jupyter Notebook (customer_segmentation.ipynb) to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.
	4.	The following visualizations will be saved as PNG images:
	•	Age Distribution (Age_Distribution.png)
	•	Annual Income Distribution (Annual_Income_Distribution.png)
	•	Spending Score Distribution (Spending_Score_Distribution.png)
	•	Pairplot of Age, Income, and Spending Score (Pairplot_Customer_Data.png)

Data

The dataset used in this project is Mall_Customers.csv, which contains customer demographic details (such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score). Ensure the dataset is located in the correct directory or modify the file path in the code accordingly.

Note: Be sure to replace dataset file names in the code with the actual downloaded file name and check that it is in the correct location.

Visualizations

This project includes the following key visualizations:
	1.	Age Distribution (Histogram with KDE): A histogram displaying the distribution of customer ages, with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) overlay to visualize the data’s distribution.
	2.	Annual Income Distribution: A histogram showing the distribution of customer income across the dataset.
	3.	Spending Score Distribution: A visualization representing how customer spending scores are distributed within the dataset.
	4.	Pairplot of Age, Income, and Spending Score: A pairplot to explore the relationships between customer age, income, and spending score.

All visualizations are saved as PNG images in the specified directory and can be viewed or used in reports.
